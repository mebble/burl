## Testing

Run the application in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

In another terminal window, open the Cypress runner

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

In the Cypress runner, select the test file you want to run. This test will be run in a Cypress-controlled browser. Then as you update your tests and the corresponding application code, you can re-run the tests from the Cypress browser.
